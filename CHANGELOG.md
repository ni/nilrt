### meta-nilrt
- meta-nilrt is now compatible with the OE "kirkstone" release.
- Where experimental RAUC content conflicted with NILRT 10 development, it [has been dropped](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/513). Do not expect any remaining RAUC content to be functional.
- NILRT builds will [now generate](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/567) SPDX SBOM files for packages and images.

#### Added
- Migrated some recipes to meta-nilrt, which were dropped from upstream meta-OE, as of kirkstone.
    - [python-nose](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/365f8514)

- Converted several legacy python recipes to use the `setuptools3_legacy` compatibility bbclass from upstream yocto.
- The `util-linux` packages [now depend](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/505) on `busybox`, because we use initscripts from the latter.
- [Set](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/591) the meta-layer priority of meta-nilrt to `25`, to get it higher than the distro's subordinate layers.
- [Upgraded](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/589) `linux-nilrt-debug` and `linux-nilrt-nohz` kernels to base on Linux 6.1.
- [Upgraded](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/601) the `linux-nilrt` kernel to base on Linux 6.1.

#### Deprecated
- [Dropped](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/d1e98a5331ba34866c1eb41537bf9267c6a7178a) the meta-nilrt `apr` bbappend, since it broke recipe `do_compile` and didn't seem to have a purpose.
- [Dropped](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/c8809128) the `ni-refpolicy` SELinux security reference policy, because it wasn't maintainable and didn't have a clear owner.
- Dropped ([1](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/037f9e09), [2](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/82dbf99d)) .patches from the `wpa-supplicant` recipe which conflicted with kirkstone and don't add apparent value.
- [Replaced](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/592) the obsolete and unmaintained `pycrypto` library, with the `pycryptodome` alternative.
- [Removed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/600) the `python3-pysnmp` package, because it has poor support and is unneeded.
- [Removed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/605) the `tbtadm` package, in favor of `bolt`.
- [Deprecated](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/616) the `dsa` host-key from being used in the default `openssh` server configuration, due to its relative insecurity.

#### Fixed
- [Fixed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/500) a sporadic `glibc:do_package` error, caused by the `stashed-locale` directory dropping out of the recipe-build workspace.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/commit/625e1c3d) a bug in the `linux-kernel-debug:do_install` where the recipe sourced kernel debug symbols from the wrong path.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/562) some salt incompatibilities with the python3.10 runtime, which broke software installation workflows using sysapi and SystemLink.
- [Increased](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/611) the `RCVBUF` buffer size for busybox's ifplugd implementation, to fix a possible configuration failure on systems with very large numbers of network interfaces.
- [Fixed](https://github.com/ni/meta-nilrt/pull/614) an incompatibility between LabVIEW and the `status_led` binary in `ni-utils`, which prevented the status LED from blinking when an LVRT startup app crashes.

## 2.0
Branch: `nilrt/14.0`

### Added
- Add support for the Intel x86_64 architecture.
    - Enables support of new targets; one example is the Performance CompactRIO
    - x86_x64 devices rely on an updated LTSI 3.10 based kernel which includes updates to PREEMPT_RT. Note that ARM devices still use the 3.2 based kernel.
    - x86_x64 devices use the ext4 journaling file system
    - x86_x64 devices use a UEFI BIOS
    - x86_x64 devices use GRUB 2 as the bootloader, as opposed to U-Boot on ARM devices x86_x64 devices support an XFCE desktop environment, which enables display and HMI use cases through a monitor directly cabled to the device. Learn more about HMIs at http://www.ni.com/white-paper/12602/en/
- NI Package Repository
    - Users can now get Linux packages from NI, instead of relying on the un-maintained Angstrom repositories. The update to the NI hosted package repository is automatically done when users upgrade the software on their devices to 2014. The repository can be manually browsed at download.ni.com/ni-linux-rt
- NI Source Repository
    - Users can now easily pull down the NI Linux RT kernel. Useful and convenient for advanced users intending to make customizations to the distribution. Available at github.com/ni
- On Target Module Versioning
    - Eliminates rebuilding kernel modules for all kernel updates, and allows kernel modules built against older versions of the kernel to be more easily supported on updated kernels
- Secure Digital High Capacity Support
    - Available on Performance CompactRIO and NI System on Module devices with an SD Card slot interface
- WebDAV File Browser
    - Enables secure, browser based authenticated access to the filesystem on all NI embedded devices

### Changed
- OpenEmbedded Update on ARM targets
    - Applies to Zynq based devices: cRIO-9068, myRIO, etc.
    - New user mode libraries. Users will no longer run into conflicts about improper versions of core libraries not being present when trying to load other applications/packages from the Linux community onto their target. Notably, the GCC package was updated as a part of this feature to GCC 4.7
- Update to udev from mdev
    - Updated the device manager from mdev to udev. udev enables dynamic device enumeration and configuration which allows for easier device management and hotplug functionality

### Security
- Released with the newest OpenSSL package (among other packages) to avoid Heartbleed and other vulnerabilities altogether. No NI products were ever affected by Heartbleed as a result.

## 1.0

- Initial release of NI Linux Real-Time
    - Hardware Support for ARM devices: (Zynq based CompactRIO-9068 and myRIO targets)
